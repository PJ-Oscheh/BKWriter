A quick-n-dirty solution to make the Chestshop plugin work on Java servers for Bedrock players connected via Floodgates. Talk about a specific issue

This is a simple script that manually adds any Bedrock players to Chestshop's users.db file. I don't know Java, let alone how to make a proper plugin, so this is what I got. The script probably needs to be run locally and connect via FTP to modify the file.

Still WIP I guess.
