# BKWriter
A quick-n-dirty solution to make the Chestshop plugin work on Java servers for Bedrock players connected via Floodgates. Talk about a specific issue

This is a simple script that manually adds any Bedrock players to Chestshop's users.db file. I don't know Java, let alone how to make a proper plugin, so this is what I got. The script probably needs to be run locally and connect via FTP to modify the file.

I designed this for my own server, Burg Kurg (hence the "BK"), but it may be used on any server!

Requires Chestshop*
Requires EssentialsX**

\* The code can theoretically be adapted for any other plugin. If the target plugin uses a setup identical to Chestshop's, you can just change the Chestshop's directory in the Configuration\n
** EssentialsX is used to pull player's usernames and UUIDs

Still WIP I guess.
